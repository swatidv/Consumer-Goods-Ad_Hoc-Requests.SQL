# ðŸ“Š Consumer-Goods-Ad_hoc-Requests - Codebasics SQL Project

This repository contains my project submission for the **Codebasics SQL Project**, where I worked as a junior data analyst for a fictional company, **Atliq Hardware**.

The project simulates a real-world scenario where the management team raises **10 ad hoc business requests** that require quick, data-driven insights. My task was to extract and analyze the data using SQL and then present the findings using Power BI dashboards and visuals.
